# Instagram CakePHP Component #

The Instagram CakePHP component is a lightweight wrapper for the Instagram api, including basic requests to the Instagram [endpoints](http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/) as well as the [realtime](http://instagram.com/developer/realtime/) api.

## Setup ##

You can add the repository as a git submodule to your Plugin directory after which it can be loaded as a component. For authentication the client id and the secret need to configured.

```
Configure::write('Instagram.client', 'CLIENT_ID');
Configure::write('Instagram.secret', 'SECRET');		
```

To make use of the realtime api we also need the callback url, this is where Instagram will do its requests to and you can process them

```
Configure::write('Instagram.callback_url', 'CALLBACK_URL');
```

## Example use ##

Recent media of the tag 'spring':
```
if ($this->Instagram->get('/tags/spring/media/recent') !== false) {
	print_r($this->Instagram->data);
}
```

Subscriptions to the realtime api: ```$this->Instagram->subscriptions();```

Add a subscription to the tag spring can be made like ```$this->Instagram->subscribe('tag', 'media', array('object_id' => 'spring'))```, this will call your callback url to check if a server is responding, by putting in ```$this->Instagram->verify()``` you can get your data as well as process the initial poll by Instagram.

Unsubscribing is done in a similiar fashion ```$this->Instagram->unsubscribe($subscription['id'])```
